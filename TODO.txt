x) Modify JSON.stringify to output a more readable template for questions
x) reset uploaded / selected weights when going home from completed-page
x) feedback for correctly uploaded files
x) save healthvalues to the test json file
x) ability to upload healthValues choises from local test json file
x) make final results be on the scale 0-100?
) the calculation of results seem to use several loops in several functions, might need a refactor
) make a larger informational website for the test to be a part of
) make some of the input elements, modals and other html elements into template components
x) make certain bars for certain categories different colors (attribute in questions-json)
) add inherent weights - weights irrespective of selected results - to the questions json file
) handle negative weights
) instead of making the scoring based the max possible score, base it on a "threshold" maximum - i.e if you reach X points you get 100/100
) Add "dependentWeights" to some alternatives containing conditional question answers and their respective weights.
    eg. "depenentWeights":{[
            {dependencies: [{question: 1, answer: 1},{question: 4, answer: 2}], weights: [0,0,...,0]},
            {dependencies: [{question: 3, answer: 4},{question: 14, answer: 1}], weights: [0,0,...,0]},
        ]}

x) Generate report:

x- save as text file
x- file name should contain timestamp
x- should contain final classification
x- should contain all answers ( or useful answers should be selectable when making question template )
x- privacy concerns
